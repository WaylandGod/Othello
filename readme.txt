Othello is an implementation of the board-game Othello (aka Reversi). It was created in Unity with C# as the programming language. It features:

* 3D animation of plays
* Computer opponent (opening book, alpha-beta pruning negamax)
* Undo/redo and replay of games
* Archived game stats for each square
* Save/load of games
* Displays potential plays

To be able to compile the source code (in either Visual Studio or MonoDevelop), you will need Unity. See http://unity3d.com/.

More information about the project can be found at http://ledpup.blogspot.com.au/search/label/Reversi.

What I'm working on:

* Improving the evaluation function of the computer opponent
* Removing memory leaks in the depth-first search
